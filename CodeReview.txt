Code Review Lab03  

In this program we work with a class called Dice.java that contains the private properties of a dice as it’s name, 

it’s number of sides and it’s side up. 

This class contains three different constructors. 

We get private values of dice’s properties via getters and we set value to these properties via setters because they are all 

private and we cannot change them outside the Dice class.


We have a public method roll(), once called on a specific dice call another method that get a 

random value between 1 and the number of sides of this dice. 

  

theoretical question: can you change the number of sides on dice, and if you do does it’s name change? 

Yes we can do that with a method that can set up the number of sides and with this number of sides we  

can change the name. 
 

Example 

public  void setUpNumSidesAndName(int numSides){ 

  this.numSides = numSides; 

  this.diceType = “{d”+numSides+”}”; 

// The name will be now this.diceType 

} 

Finally, we try to simulate a yahtzee case with a rooling up 5 dices of 6 and we loop counting each roll 

and we exit the loop once we have all sides up of the 5 dices having the same value. 

Here the better loop to use is do while and of course not for loop because we don’t know how many loops 

we are going to have and better than while loop because the loop must be at least once.
